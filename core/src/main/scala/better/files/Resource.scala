/**
  * Finds and loads [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#getResource(java.lang.String) class loader resources]].
  *
  * The ''lookup methods'' `apply`, `url`, and `asFile` look up a resource, by name. They are different in what they return: `apply` returns an [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html InputStream]], `url` returns a [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/net/URL.html URL]], and `asFile` returns a [[File]].
  *
  * By default, resources are looked up using the [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#currentThread() current thread]]'s [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#getContextClassLoader() context class loader]]. The ''modifier methods'' `at`, `from`, and `my` change this: `at` searches from a [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html Class]], `from` searches from a [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html ClassLoader]], and `my` searches from the class, trait, or object surrounding the call.
  *
  * To use a modifier method, call it, then call a lookup method on the object returned by the modifier method. See the documentation of the modifier methods for details and examples.
  *
  * @example {{{
  *          // Get an InputStream for reading META-INF/example.txt.
  *          val in: InputStream = Resource("META-INF/example.txt")
  *
  *          // Look up app.conf from the package that the caller class
  *          // is in, and get a File representing it.
  *          val confFile: File = Resource.my.asFile("app.conf")
  *          }}}
  *

  * @see [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#getResourceAsStream(java.lang.String) ClassLoader#getResourceAsStream]]
  *
  * @note As of Java SE 9, loading of class resources (using the `at` or `my` modifiers) is affected by which module is attempting to load them (that is, it's ''caller-sensitive''), in that the package that the resource is in must be [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/Module.html#isOpen(java.lang.String,java.lang.Module) open]] to the calling module. For this reason, the lookup methods are implemented as macros, so that underlying calls to [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResource(java.lang.String) Class#getResource]] or [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResourceAsStream(java.lang.String) Class#getResourceAsStream]] appear in the caller's module, rather than in the module containing the better-files library.

   * Ordinarily, we'd have a trait ResourceLookup with apply/url/asFile methods, make object Resource be the default implementation (using the context class loader), and make “modifiers” like `at` and `my` return different ResourceLookup implementations (with suitable lookup behavior).
   *
   * But we're using macros here. Macros cannot have run-time polymorphism like that, because they run at compile time! Instead, we make the modifier methods stubs (they just return this), and the macros look whether they were called on the object returned by a modifier method (even though it's just this).
